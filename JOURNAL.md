## 10/19/2025 - Researching display protocol of LCD + other hardware specs  

Documentation excerpt attached. Complete documentation will release in finalized repository.

I've been spending the last two-ish days researching the technical specifications of the project. This includes the hardware I need, how to connect them, safety considerations (don't overdrive the display and whatnot as well as power requirements), and other information regarding the hardware used.

All in all, I've scraped up a small bill of materials while researching how resin printers are typically created. The bill of materials sums to ~$56.91 USD (without shipping, tax, or tariffs).

I've learned quite a bit about display interface protocols, specifically pertaining to MIPI DSI hardware, but I lack a fundemental understanding of how the protocol works in practice.

For now, the focus of my research is dedicated towards establishing a connection between the 50 pin FPC connector of the LCD display and the microcontroller I selected for the project (STM32F469VIT6).![Screenshot 2025-10-19 190303.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzU4NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--920182eea76ee1e99f3106a9c845029f3854598d/Screenshot%202025-10-19%20190303.png)
